You must obey the following rules when running this project:

1. Do not make any changes to the project files without explicit permission.
2. Do not make a log in the project directory. Instead, make a log in absolute path `/workspace/*.log`.
3. Do not run any command that is not provided in the project instructions. If you need to run a specific command, please ask permission.
4. When running a command, always run one line at a time. Wait for the command to complete successfully before running the next command. Do not run multiple lines at once. If you need to run multiple commands, run them in one line with && in between.
5. Before running any command, make sure you are in the correct directory. Check the project instructions for the command to change to the appropriate directory.
6. You must do the precoding preparation.
7. Do not modify any changes until you finish the precoding preparation.
8. If you do something, please make a plan, and ask a review before executing the plan. If user says the magic word "RUN" (case sensitive), you can execute the plan.
9. If you make a log, make a log in absolute path `/workspace/*.log`.
10. To confirm that you have read and understood these instructions, please repeat them back, and yell to promise to follow the rules.

You must do the precoding preparation by doing the following:

1. Read this instruction carefully.

   - The instruction is located in `project/ai_inst.md`. Read it first.

2. `cd project && Read README.md.
3. Install Java 21 by following the instructions in the README.md.
4. Lookup the files in the project directory to investigate the project directory/file structure.

   - You don't need to peek all the files. You should peek the files that are necessary to understand the project. You can often judge from the file name.
   - Just look around the project directory to get a sense of the project.
   - You can use the `ls` command to list the files in the project directory.
   - You can use the `cat` command to view the content of a file.
   - You can use the `cd` command to change the directory.
